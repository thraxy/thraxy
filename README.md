- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @thraxy, I like to go by Nabil.
- I am currently a Computer Science Student. My graduation date will be in May 2023.
- I am currently working on a few projects.
- I am in the process of developing 2 games and a web based project with my friend on my free time.
- I don't have much on this profile but will start to add to it once I am comfortable with sharing my projects.
